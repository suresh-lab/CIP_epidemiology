Checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis incidence, risk factors and impact on survival

- The PD1_Pneumonitis_Analysis HTML file is the markdown containing the code and analysis pertaining to two papers from our group focused on the CIP incidence, risk factors and impact on survival.
- The markdown provides the code for the various models for the incidence paper (Suresh et al., JTO 2018) and the diagnostics run on those models, as well as a variety of exploratory data visualizations
- THe latter half of the manuscript also includes the code written specifically for the Markov Model employed in the survival paper. This includes code to convert a wide format clinical dataset into a long form where events are separated by time and a single participant may have multiple entries depending on the number of events that occured while under observation.  
- These papers were published in the J. Thoracic Onc in 2018 and 2019 respectively (PDFs of these papers and the supplemental data also provided here)
